This task involves writing three different functions without any code provided.

The first function, named print_name, takes in a character pointer and a function pointer. The function should print the name given in the first argument using the function pointer passed in as the second argument. The function pointer will determine how the name is printed.

The second function, named array_iterator, takes in an integer array, its size and a function pointer as arguments. The function should iterate through the array and execute the function passed in as the third argument on each element of the array.

The third function, named int_index, takes in an integer array, its size, and a function pointer as arguments. The function should search for an integer in the array by executing the function passed in as the third argument on each element. The first element that satisfies the condition should return its index. If there is no element that satisfies the condition, the function should return -1.
